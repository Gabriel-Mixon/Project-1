Foodoku

A site whose main function is to take ingredients from a user and then return to them a list of recipes, that will include links with full instructions, and the nutritional value of said recipes using two seperate APIs

1.Nutritionix 2. Recipe Search API

This site uses Googlefonts, Codepen, and Materialize for the styling and Unsplash is the source of the background image.

How to use:
The page prompts you visually to add ingredients and then click search. Then a list of recipes will will show up with links at the end to not only the reipes' links but also to their nutrional value, which will show up in a table below. It's a pretty straight forward site.



Instruction:


1. Enter up to three ingredients
2. Click Search
3. Find a reipe you like and click the link
4. Enjoy
